Yes, seeing as Cauchy is what Titu's Lemma is derived from. Windigo wrote: Isn't that like the definition of Titu's lemma with two fractions Pretty much, yes. djdumpling wrote: How do you prove: $$\\frac{m^2}{x}+\\frac{n^2}{y} \\ge \\frac{(m+n)^2}{x+y}$$ for x and y>0? From the responses in this thread, I think you should be good to go to solve this problem! Good luck!",
