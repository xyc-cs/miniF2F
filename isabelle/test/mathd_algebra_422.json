    "informal_statement": "Given a real number $x$ and a function $\\sigma(x) = 5x - 12$, assume that $\\sigma$ is a bijection and that $\\sigma(x+1) = \\sigma^{-1}(x)$. Show that $x = \\frac{47}{24}$.",
    "informal_proof": "Step 1: Use the given information to write an equation involving $\\sigma$ and its inverse.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation to obtain an expression for $\\sigma^{-1}(x)$.\n\nStep 3: Use the equation $\\sigma(x+1) = \\sigma^{-1}(x)$ to obtain an equation involving $x$.\n\nStep 4: Solve for $x$ and show that $x = \\frac{47}{24}$."
