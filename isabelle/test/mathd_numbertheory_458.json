    "informal_statement": "When all the girls at Madeline's school line up in rows of eight, there are seven left over.\n\nIf instead they line up in rows of four, how many are left over? Show that it is 3.",
    "informal_proof": "The number of girls is of the form $8n+7$, where $n$ is some integer (the number of rows). This expression can also be written as $4(2n+1)+3$, so when the girls line up in rows of four, they make $2n+1$ rows with $3$ girls left over."
