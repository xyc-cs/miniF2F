    "informal_statement": "Let $n$ be a positive integer.  What is the greatest possible value of $\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)$? Show that it is 13.",
    "informal_proof": "Let $d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)$, so $d$ divides both $n + 7$ and $2n + 1$.  Then $d$ divides $2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = 13$, so $d$ is at most 13.\n\nIf $n = 6$, then $\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(13,13) = 13$, which shows that the value of 13 is attainable.  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)$ is $13$."
