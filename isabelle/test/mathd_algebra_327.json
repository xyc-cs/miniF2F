    "informal_statement": "Solve for $a$: $\\frac15|9+2a|<1$.  Express your answer in interval notation. Show that it is (-7, -2).",
    "informal_proof": "Multiplying by 5 gives $|9+2a|<5$, so we must have  $$-5 < 9+2a < 5.$$Subtracting 9 from all three parts of this inequality chain gives  $$-14 < 2a < -4,$$and dividing by 2 gives $-7 < a < -2,$ or $a \\in (-7, -2)$ in interval notation."
