    "informal_statement": "(i) Solve the simultaneous inequalities, $x<\\frac{1}{4x}$ and $x<0$ ; i.e. find a single inequality equivalent to the two simultaneous inequalities. (ii) What is the greatest integer that satisfies both inequalities $4x+13 < 0$ and $x^{2}+3x > 16$ . (iii) Give a rational number between $11/24$ and $6/13$ . (iv) Express 100000 as a product of two integers neither of which is an integral multiple of 10. (v) Without the use of logarithm tables evaluate \\[\\frac{1}{\\log_{2}36}+\\frac{1}{\\log_{3}36}.\\]",

        "Sample Answer 1: I'm bored, so I'll just post these solutions. i) $4x^{2}>1\\implies x>\\frac{1}{2}, x<-\\frac{1}{2}$ ii) Too boring. iii ) $\\frac{\\frac{11}{24}+\\frac{6}{13}}{2}$ iv ) $100000=2^{5}\\cdot 5^{5}$ v ) $\\log_{36}2+\\log_{36}3=\\frac{1}{2}$ EDIT: Typo in i). I had forgotten a negative in the result.",
        "Sample Answer 2: Ok so boxedexe got i,iii,iv,v... That leaves problem $x^{2}+3x>16\\implies x^{2}+3x+9/4 > 73/4$ $\\implies x> \\frac{\\sqrt{73}-3}{2}\\approx 2.77\\;\\text{or}\\;x<\\frac{-\\sqrt{73}-3}{2}\\approx-5.77$ $4x+13 < 0 \\implies x <-3.25$ Largest number is $x=-6$",
        "Sample Answer 3: why are there 5 parts? also i don't see how this can possibly get on an olympiad...",
        "Sample Answer 4: its from 1973..plus its question 1..so free marks i guess",
        "Sample Answer 5: yeah... there were 7 problems anyway",
        "Sample Answer 6: haha. $x<\\frac{1}{4x}$ $4x^{2}<1$ $x^{2}<1/4$ $\\frac{-1}{2}<x<\\frac{1}{2}$ $x<0$ $-1/2<x<0$ 11/24=143/312=286/624 6/13=144/312=288/624 287/624 100000=2^5*3^5 $\\frac{1}{\\log_{2}36}=\\frac{\\log_{2}2}{\\log_{2}36}=\\log_{36}2$ $\\frac{1}{\\log_{3}36}=\\frac{\\log_{3}3}{\\log_{3}36}=\\log_{36}3$ $\\log_{36}2*\\log_{36}3=\\log_{36}6=\\frac{1}{2}$",
        "Sample Answer 7: You solved i) incorrectly.",
        "Sample Answer 8: chess64 wrote: $x<0$ *cough*",
        "Sample Answer 9: Yeah, I forgot to write down that the case $x>\\frac{1}{2}$ does not count, but you forgot to flip the inequality, thus you obtained a wrong answer.",
        "Sample Answer 10: In V, I wrote a * instead of a + in the last sentence."
