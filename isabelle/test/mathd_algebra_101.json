    "informal_statement": "For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation. Show that it is x \\in [-2,7].",
    "informal_proof": "Re-arranging, $x^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0$. The left-hand quadratic factors as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \\le 0$. Thus, $x-7$ and $x+2$ have opposite signs, so $-2 \\le x \\le 7$ and $x \\in [-2,7]$."
