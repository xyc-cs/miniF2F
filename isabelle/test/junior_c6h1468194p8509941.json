        "Sample Answer 10: Yes. I agree. Many juniors said that problem was difficult. It is because they like to solve classical inequalities with Cauchy, Schur etc. and don't think out of frames. Your problem is very nice. Something similar (inequalities in N, Z, Q) I had posted here on 20 Oct 2016 https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/q1h1329045p7155572",

Proposed by Dorlir Ahmeti, Albania The original inequality is equivalent to $$(x+y+z)(xy+yz+zx) -9xyz\\ge 2(x+y+z),$$ or $$x(y-z)^2+y(x-z)^2+z(x-y)^2 \\ge 2(x+y+z).$$ Note that among $x+y-2z,\\, y+z-2x,\\, z+x-2y,$ there are two numbers having the same sign. Without loss of generality, assume that $(x+y-2z)(x+z-2y) \\ge 0.$ We have $$2(x+y+z) \\le 2(y-z)^2(x+y+z).$$ Therefore, it suffices to prove that $$y(x-z)^2+z(x-y)^2 \\ge x(y-z)^2+2(y+z)(y-z)^2,$$ or $$(y+z)(x-y)(x-z) \\ge 2(y+z)(y-z)^2.$$ The last inequality is equivalent to $$(x-y)(x-z) -2(y-z)^2 \\ge 0,$$ or $$(x+z-2y)(x+y-2z) \\ge 0,$$ which is true.",

(Datis-Kalali) The main idea is similar to the one of the original problem. Wlog assume $z> y > x$ , then $z\\geq3$ , $x\\geq 2$ , $x\\geq 1$ and so $xyz\\geq 6$ . So, $$ xyz(x^2+y^2+z^2-2) \\geq 6(x^2+y^2+z^2-2)$$ Hence it is enough to show that $$6(x^2+y^2+z^2-2) \\geq 24(x+y+z-3) \\Leftrightarrow (x-2)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-2)^2 \\geq 2$$ which is obviously holds beacause $x\\neq y\\neq z \\neq x$ .
