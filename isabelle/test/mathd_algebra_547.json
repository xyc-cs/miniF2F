The Python snippet uses the sympy package to create a symbolic expression. The sympy package is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. The sympy package is used to create a symbolic expression for the expression $\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}$. The sympy package is used to substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression. The sympy package is used to simplify the expression.\n\n        The Isabelle snippet is a bit more complicated than the Python snippet.
