        "Sample Answer 1: From the problem we see that d+e>c+d leading to e>c and b+c>a+b leading to c>a so we have a<c<e so far b+c>c+d so b>d and e+aa leading to A is the lowest as b,c,d,e are greater as we also know the highest plus lowest is the middle so e+a is highest +lowest leading to E is greatest and A is lowest Not sure if my reasoning for E is correct someone might have to recheck.",
        "Sample Answer 2: TheIntegral wrote: The five numbers $a, b, c, d,$ and $e$ satisfy the inequalities $$a+b < c+d < e+a < b+c < d+e.$$ Among the five numbers, which one is the smallest, and which one is the largest? @above hide your answer in a hide tag like [hide][/hide] if 2 of the expressions being compared share a number, the other numbers of those 2 expressions can be compared so then $a+b<e+a => b<e$ $a+b<b+c => a<c$ $c+d<d+e => c<e$ $e+a<d+e => a<d$ $c+d<b+c => d<b$ so we have $a<d<b<e$ and $a<c<e$ therefore $a$ is the smallest and $e$ is the largest",
        "Sample Answer 3: $a+b<e+a\\implies b<e\\quad(1)$ $a+b<b+c\\implies a<c\\quad(2)$ $c+d<b+c\\implies d<b\\quad(3)$ $c+d<d+e\\implies c<e\\quad(4)$ $e+a<d+e\\implies a<d\\quad(5)$ $(1),(3),(5)\\implies a<d<b<e$ $\\implies \\max(a,b,c,d,e) = e; \\min(a,b,c,d,e) = a$ edit: double sniped"
