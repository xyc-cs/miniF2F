    "informal_statement": "Define a function on the positive integers recursively by $f(1) = 2$, $f(n) = f(n-1) + 1$ if $n$ is even, and $f(n) = f(n-2) + 2$ if $n$ is odd and greater than $1$. What is $f(2017)$?\n\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 2017 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 2018 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4034 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 4035 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4036 $ Show that it is \\textbf{(B)}.",
    "informal_proof": "This is a recursive function, which means the function refers back to itself to calculate subsequent terms. To solve this, we must identify the base case, $f(1)=2$. We also know that when $n$ is odd, $f(n)=f(n-2)+2$. Thus we know that $f(2017)=f(2015)+2$. Thus we know that n will always be odd in the recursion of $f(2017)$, and we add $2$ each recursive cycle, which there are $1008$ of. Thus the answer is $1008*2+2=2018$, which is answer\n$\\textbf{(B)}$.\nNote that when you write out a few numbers, you find that $f(n)=n+1$ for any $n$, so $f(2017)=2018$",
