    "informal_statement": "Let $a, b, c, d, e \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ and $f:\\{(x, y) \\in (\\mathbb{R}^+)^2|c-dx-ey > 0\\}\\to \\mathbb{R}^+$ be given by $f(x, y) = (ax)(by)(c- dx- ey)$ . Find the maximum value of $f$ .",

        "Sample Answer 1: We have that $f(x,y)=\\frac{a}{d}\\frac{b}{e}(dx)(ey)(c-dx-ey)\\leq \\frac{a}{d}\\frac{b}{e}\\left(\\frac{c}{3}\\right)^3$ by the AM-GM inequality. Equality holds iff $dx=ey=c-dx-ey\\Leftrightarrow (x,y)=(\\frac{c}{3d},\\frac{c}{3e})$ . Since $(\\frac{c}{3d},\\frac{c}{3e})\\in \\{(x, y)\\in (\\mathbb{R}^{+})^{2}|c-dx-ey > 0\\}$ , equality holds. We conclude that the maximum of $f$ is $ \\frac{a}{d}\\frac{b}{e}\\left(\\frac{c}{3}\\right)^3$",
        "Sample Answer 2: Nice solution, Jorge. I solved it the standard and ugly way: determining the only stationary point of the function."
