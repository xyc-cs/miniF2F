    "informal_statement": "Given a natural number $n$ such that $n$ leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 8 (i.e., $n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$), show that $n$ leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 (i.e., $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$).",
    "informal_proof": "Step 1: Use the fact that $n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$ to express $n$ in the form $8q + 7$ for some integer $q$.\n\nStep 2: Use the expression for $n$ from Step 1 to compute $n \\pmod{4}$ and prove that it is equal to 3."
