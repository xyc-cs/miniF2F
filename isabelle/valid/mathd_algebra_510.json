    "informal_statement": "Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are two real numbers such that $x+y=13$ and $xy=24.$ Find $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and show that it is equal to 11.",
    "informal_proof": "Step 1: Use the identity $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy$ to find $x^2+y^2$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n\nStep 2: Substitute the given values of $x$ and $y$ to find $x^2+y^2$.\n\nStep 3: Show that $x^2+y^2=121$.\n\nStep 4: Take the square root of both sides to find $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n\nStep 5: Show that $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=11$."
