    "informal_statement": "Given that $x + y = 13$ and $xy = 24$, find the distance from the point $(x, y)$ to the origin. Show that it is 11.",
    "informal_proof": "The distance from $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We note that $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2xy = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$, so $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-48} = \\sqrt{121} = 11$."
