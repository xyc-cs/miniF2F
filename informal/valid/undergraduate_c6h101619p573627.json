    "informal_statement": "Prove that for each $m\\geq1$ : \\[\\sum_{|k|<\\sqrt m}\\binom{2m}{m+k}\\geq 2^{2m-1}\\] Maybe probabilistic method works",
    "informal_discuss": [
        "Sample Answer 1: $\\sum_{k<\\sqrt m}\\binom{2m}{m+k}=\\sum_{-m\\leq k<\\sqrt m}\\binom{2m}{m+k}\\geq \\sum_{-m\\leq k \\leq 0}\\binom{2m}{m+k}\\geq 2^{2m-1}$ . Maybe Omid Hatami meant $\\sum_{|k|<\\sqrt m}\\binom{2m}{m+k}\\geq 2^{2m-1}$ , or the more restrictive $\\sum_{0\\leq k<\\sqrt m}\\binom{2m}{m+k}\\geq 2^{2m-1}$ .",
        "Sample Answer 2: Excuse me I corrected it.",
        "Sample Answer 3: Nobody interested?",
        "Sample Answer 4: You want an equivalence with probabilistic methods. If we have a random variable that follows a binomial distribution $X\\sim B(n=2m,p=1/2)$ , with mean $E\\{ X\\}=np=m$ , and variance $\\sigma^{2}=E\\{(X-E\\{ X\\})^{2}\\}=np(1-p)=m/2$ , the past problem is equivalent to $P((X-E\\{X\\})^{2}<2\\sigma^{2})\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ .",
        "Sample Answer 5: in exam paper the hint was a bit more complete in that it was given to use chebyshev inequality to attain solution. without hint this problem is really tough but with the hint given it turned to easy problem at the exam.",
        "Sample Answer 6: To lordWings :And the last inequality you wrote is Chebyshev's inequality $P(\\left|X-\\mu\\right|\\geq k\\sigma)\\leq\\frac{1}{k^{2}}$ My Solution : You see that \\[\\sum_{|k|>\\sqrt m}\\binom{2m}{m+k}=\\frac{\\sum_{|k|\\geq\\sqrt m}m\\binom{2m}{m+k}}{m}\\leq\\frac{\\sum_{|k|\\geq\\sqrt m}k^{2}\\binom{2m}{m+k}}{m}\\leq\\frac{\\sum_{k=-m}^{m}k^{2}\\binom{2m}{m+k}}{m}\\] \\[=\\frac{m2^{2m-1}}{m}=2^{2m-1}\\] Everything's proved."
