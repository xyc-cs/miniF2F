        "Sample Answer 1: Are you sure this is supposed to be in HSM?",
        "Sample Answer 2: because it is? not responding to the second post, the original question i meant",
        "Sample Answer 3: $50^{50}>50!$ because $50^{50}=50\\cdot 50\\cdot 50\\cdot ... 50$ where $50$ is multiplied by itself $50$ times, and $50!=50\\cdot 49\\cdot 48\\cdot...\\cdot 1$ , and $50^{50}$ is obviously greater than $50!$ because if we line them up: $50\\cdot 50\\cdot 50\\cdot...\\cdot 50$ ( 50 times) $50\\cdot 49\\cdot 48\\cdot...\\cdot 1$ , and we see that the number we are multiplying stays constant in $50^{50}$ , but the number we are multiplying in $50!$ decreases each time, and the number we start with is the same, so hence proved.",
        "Sample Answer 4: There are $50$ numbers being multiplied in $50^{50}$ and $50$ numbers being multiplied in $50!$ . Knowing that $50! = 50\\cdot 50\\cdot 50\\cdot...\\cdot 50$ , everynumber (except for the two $50$ s ) being multiplied in $50!$ is less than the numbers being multiplied in $50^{50}$ . Because $50/49, 50/48, 50/47, ... 50/1$ are all greater than 1, we know that $50^{50} > 50!$",

        "Sample Answer 11: @above the question was prove that $50^{50} > 50!$ . The $!$ means that you multiply every number from $1$ to the number that is before the $!$ . Then we\u2019d do $50 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 48 \\cdot ... 2 \\cdot 1$ .",

        "Sample Answer 15: rigorously, we can do this inductively: base case: $2^2 > 2!$ if $n^n>n!$ , then $(n+1)^{(n+1)}>(n+1)!$ $(n+1)^{(n+1)}=n^n \\cdot n(n+1)$ $(n+1)! = (n+1) \\cdot n!$ therefore, we get the experssion $n(n+1) > (n+1)$ , which is obviously true for all positive integers $n \\geq 1$ .",

        "Sample Answer 26: Base case: $n = 2$ Claim: $2^2 > 2$ Proof: $2^2 > 2 \\longrightarrow 4 > 2$ , hence we are done. Induction step Claim: $n^n > n! \\longrightarrow (n+1)^{n+1} > (n+1)!$ Proof: Theorem 1: Claim: $(n+1)^{n+1} > n^{n+1}$ Proof: Subtheorem 1: Claim: $n+1$ is positive Proof: By the induction step, $n > 2$ , and since $2 > 0, n > 2 > 0$ , and by the fundamental axioms of inequality, $n > 0$ . Since we have not done any steps which can't be reversed, we are done. By Subtheorem 1, since $n+1$ is positive, we can take both sides to the power of $\\frac{1}{n+1}$ . By the fundamental laws of exponents, this leaves us with $n+1 > n \\longrightarrow 1 > 0$ by subtraction. Since we did not do any steps which could not be reversed, we are done. By theorem 1, and the fundamental axioms of inequality, we can say that if we prove $n^{n+1} \\geq (n+1)!$ , then we prove the original statement. New claim: $n^{n+1} \\geq (n+1)!$ Proof: Let's divide both sides by $n$ to give us $n^n \\geq n! \\cdot \\frac{n+1}{n}$ . Now we will prove that $n^n$ will always be greater than $n!$ by more than the factor of $\\frac{n+1}{n}$ , and hence prove the original statement. Theorem 2 Claim: $n^n$ will always be greater than $n!$ by more than a factor of $\\frac{n+1}{n}$ Proof: Since it's very obvious that it will grow much much much bigger exponentially by the fundamental theorem of the AoPS posts on the thread \"Inequality of Numbers\" by JND, and in fact I have wasted my past $15$ minutes writing this all out, we are done.",
