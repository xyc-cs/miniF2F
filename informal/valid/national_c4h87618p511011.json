Oh ! what did you do? I think you did a bad solution. the first limit does not really prove anything...only that it is bounded but i don't see why that is important, but the second part, the calculus way works fine, once you have that it is a decreasing function, it is immediately true that $f(n)<f(n-1)$ which was what we wanted ( $W^{5}$ for acops readers )",
        "Sample Answer 8: Here is a very simple solution since it does not require a proof or anything. Let $c=1$ . You have the two numbers $\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{1}$ and $\\sqrt{1}-\\sqrt{0}$ . The first number becomes $\\sqrt{2}-1$ amd the second $1$ . Now, for $\\sqrt{2}-1$ to be greater than 1, $\\sqrt{2}$ must be greater than 2. That means $\\sqrt{2}$ must be greater than $\\sqrt{4}$ since 2 is the square root of 4, because it is not, the answer is clearly $\\sqrt{c}-\\sqrt{c-1}$ .",

Anyhow, here's my solution: Let's assume that $\\sqrt{c+1}-\\sqrt{c}> \\sqrt{c}-\\sqrt{c-1}$ . $\\sqrt{c+1}-\\sqrt{c}> \\sqrt{c}-\\sqrt{c-1}$ $\\sqrt{c+1}-\\sqrt{c-1}> 2\\sqrt{c}$ $2c+2\\sqrt{c^{2}-1}>4c$ $\\sqrt{c^{2}-1}>c$ $c^{2}-1>c^{2}$ $0>1$ Quite obviously this is a contradiction.

Consider $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ , so $f''(x) = \\frac{-1}{4\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ , so it's concave on $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$ . Therefore, Jensen says that \\[\\begin{aligned}&amp; \\frac{f(c+1)+f(c-1)}{2}\\leq f\\left(\\frac{(c+1)+(c-1)}{2}\\right)\\ \\\\ &amp; \\Longleftrightarrow\\ \\sqrt{c+1}+\\sqrt{c-1}\\leq 2\\sqrt{c}\\ \\\\ &amp; \\Longleftrightarrow\\ \\sqrt{c+1}-\\sqrt{c}\\leq \\sqrt{c}-\\sqrt{c-1}.\\end{aligned}\\]But equality occurs iff $c+1=c-1$ , i.e. $2=0$ .

An alternate way to do this would be to claim that $\\sqrt{c+1}+\\sqrt{c-1}<2\\sqrt{c}$ , which would follow by squaring both sides to get $c+1+c-1+2\\sqrt{c^2-1}<4c$ , $2\\sqrt{c^2-1}<2c$ , which is clearly true since $\\sqrt{c^2-1}<\\sqrt{c^2}=c$ .",
        "Sample Answer 23: We claim that $\\sqrt{c+1} - \\sqrt{c} < \\sqrt{c} - \\sqrt{c-1}$ for all $c \\geq 1.$ Clearly, we have $$c^2 - c + \\frac{1}{4} > c^2 - c.$$ Since $c \\geq 1,$ we have $c^2 - c \\geq 0,$ so both sides are positive. Thus, we can take the square root of both sides to get $$c - \\frac{1}{2} > \\sqrt{c(c-1)}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $4$ gives $$4c-2 > 4\\sqrt{c(c-1)}.$$ We can rearrange this to $$c + 1 < 4c + 4\\sqrt{c(c-1)} + c - 1.$$ Rewriting this yields $$(\\sqrt{c+1})^2 < (2\\sqrt{c} - \\sqrt{c-1})^2.$$ Clearly, both $\\sqrt{c+1}$ and $2\\sqrt{c} - \\sqrt{c-1}$ are nonnegative for $c \\geq 1,$ so we can take the square root of both sides to get $$\\sqrt{c+1} < 2\\sqrt{c} - \\sqrt{c-1}.$$ Rearranging gives us $$\\sqrt{c+1} - c < \\sqrt{c} - \\sqrt{c-1}.$$ $\\square$",
