    "informal_proof": "We begin with a system of two equations \\begin{align*}\n2d&=17e-8\n\\\\2e&=d-9\n\\end{align*}Since the second equation can also be rewritten as $d=2e+9$, we can plug this expression for $d$ back into the first equation and solve for $e$ \\begin{align*}\n2d&=17e-8\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2(2e+9)&=17e-8\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 4e+18&=17e-8\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad -13e&=-26\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad e&=2.\n\\end{align*}"
