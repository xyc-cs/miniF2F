    "informal_proof": "Let the first term be $ a $ and the common ratio be $ r $. Therefore, \n\n$ar=2\\ \\ (1) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad ar^3=6\\ \\ (2)$\n\nDividing $(2)$ by $(1)$ eliminates the $ a $, yielding $ r^2=3 $, so $ r=\\pm\\sqrt{3} $.\n\nNow, since $ ar=2 $, $ a=\\frac{2}{r} $, so $ a=\\frac{2}{\\pm\\sqrt{3}}=\\pm\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} $.\n\nWe therefore see that $ \\textbf{(B)}\\ -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} $ is a possible first term.",
