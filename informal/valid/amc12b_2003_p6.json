    "informal_statement": "The second and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are $2$ and $6$. Which of the following is a possible first term?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } -\\sqrt{3}  \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } \\sqrt{3} \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } 3$ Show that it is \\textbf{(B)}\\ -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}.",
    "informal_proof": "Let the first term be $ a $ and the common ratio be $ r $. Therefore, \n\n$ar=2\\ \\ (1) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad ar^3=6\\ \\ (2)$\n\nDividing $(2)$ by $(1)$ eliminates the $ a $, yielding $ r^2=3 $, so $ r=\\pm\\sqrt{3} $.\n\nNow, since $ ar=2 $, $ a=\\frac{2}{r} $, so $ a=\\frac{2}{\\pm\\sqrt{3}}=\\pm\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} $.\n\nWe therefore see that $ \\textbf{(B)}\\ -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} $ is a possible first term.",
