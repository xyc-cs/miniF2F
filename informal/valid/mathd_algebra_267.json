    "informal_statement": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}$ Show that it is 0.",
    "informal_proof": "Cross-multiplying (which is the same as multiplying both sides by $x-1$ and by $x+2$) gives \\[(x+1)(x+2) = (x-2)(x-1).\\] Expanding the products on both sides gives  \\[x^2 + 3x + 2 = x^2 -3x +2.\\] Subtracting $x^2$ and 2 from both sides gives  $3x=-3x$, so $6x=0$ and $x=0$."
