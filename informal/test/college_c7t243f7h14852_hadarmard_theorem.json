        "Sample Answer 2: Alison wrote: Well, by weighted Jensen or majorization, $f(x_1) + f(x_2) \\ge f(x_1 + a) + f(x_2 - a) \\ge 2 f(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2})$ for $0 \\le a \\le x_2 - x_1$ . Integrate over that range, divide through, and you're done. For a convex function, it is obvious that f(x1) + f(x2) >= 2f([x1+x2]/2) It is also obvious that f(x1 + a) + f(x2 - a) >= 2f([x1+x2]/2) I can see that the majorization inequality implies f(x1) + f(x2) >= f(x1 + a) + f(x2 - a), however, I cannot figure out how Jensen's or weighted Jensen's implies this. I came up with a proof on my own via considering: WOLOG, a <= (x2-x1)/2 [f(x1) - f(x1 + a)]/[-a] = f'(b1), b1 E (x1, x1+a) [f(x2 - a) - f(x2)]/[-a] = f'(b2), b2 E (x2-a, x2) via the MVT. f'(b2) >= f'(b1), so the result follows. Anyone want to tell me how weighted Jensen's implies the first part of the above inequality?",
        "Sample Answer 3: Weighted Jensen or Karamata: If $x_1>x_2$ and $y_1>y_2$ and $x_1+x_2=y_1+y_2$ and $x_1>y_1$ then $f(x_1)+f(x_2)>f(y_1)+f(y_2)$ because we can easily find $\\alpha$ with $y_1=\\alpha x_1+(1-\\alpha)x_2$ and $y_2=\\alpha x_2+(1-\\alpha)x_1$ now apply Jensen and sum",

I knew that as majorization."
