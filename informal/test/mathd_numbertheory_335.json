    "informal_statement": "When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7? Show that it is 4.",
    "informal_proof": "Let $n$ be Rachel's favorite number.  Then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, so $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$."
