    "informal_statement": "Prove that for any natural number $n$, $3$ divides $n^3 + 2n$.",
    "informal_proof": "Step 1: Prove the base case $n = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Assume the statement is true for some $n$ and prove it for $n+1$.\n\nStep 3: Expand $(n+1)^3 + 2(n+1)$ and simplify.\n\nStep 4: Use the assumption that $3$ divides $n^3 + 2n$ to show that $3$ divides $3n^2 + 3n + 3$.\n\nStep 5: Combine steps 3 and 4 to show that $3$ divides $(n+1)^3 + 2(n+1)$.\n\nStep 6: Conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers $n$."
