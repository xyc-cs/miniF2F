    "informal_proof": "We show the result by induction on $n$. The result is trivial for $n=1$. Let us assume it is true for $n \\geq 1$.\nWe have that $\\sum_{k=0}^{(n+1)-1} (2k + 1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 1) + (2n + 1)$.\nThe induction hypothesis tells us that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 1) = n^2$. So $\\sum_{k=0}^{(n+1)-1} (2k + 1) = n^2 + 2n +1 = (n+1)^2$ and the result is true for $n+1$.\nBy induction, we conclude that the result is true for all positive integer $n$."
