    "informal_statement": "What is the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9? Show that it is 1.",
    "informal_proof": "Looking at our sum, we can see that the numbers $1$ through $8$ can be paired off to form $9,$ so we may eliminate them. That is, $1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5 = 9.$ Therefore, the only remaining terms are $9$ and $10,$ and $9$ is obviously also divisible by $9,$ hence we only need to find the remainder of $10$ when divided by $9,$ which is $1.$",
