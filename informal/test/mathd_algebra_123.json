    "informal_statement": "Together, Amy and Betty have 20 apples. Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. How many more apples than Betty does Amy have? Show that it is 10.",
    "informal_proof": "Call the amount of apples Amy has $a$ and the amount of apples Betty has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 20 \\\\\na &= 3b \\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$. So Amy has $15 - 5 = 10$ more apples than Betty.",
