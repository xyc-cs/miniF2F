        "Sample Answer 1: Clearly, $a>b$ . If $a\\ge b+4$ , then $a^3-b^3-12ab=3ab(a-b-4)+(a-b)^3>0$ , contradiction. If $a\\leq b+2$ , then $a^3-b^3-11ab=(a-b)^3-ab(11-3(a-b))\\leq 8-5ab\\leq -2<0$ , contradiction. Hence, $a=b+3$ . This gives us $$11b(b+3)\\leq (b+3)^3-b^3\\leq 12b(b+3)\\Leftrightarrow 9\\leq b(b+3)\\leq \\frac{27}2\\Rightarrow b=2$$ So the only solution is $(a,b)=(5,2)$ .",

        "Sample Answer 13: I overcomplicated things again Assume that there is such pairs $(a,b)$ exists. fix $b=b_0$ . Let $f: N \\rightarrow N$ , $f(a)=a^3-11ab_0-b_0^3$ $f(a) \\ge 0$ . note that $f'(a)= 3a^2-11b_0$ . then we can see that function is strictly increasing since $a>b$ , $\\min a= b_0+1$ , $f'(a) >0 $ and $f''(a)>0$ sinc e $ f(a) \\ge 0$ , and $a,b_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , we can try small values $a$ and find a lower bound for $a$ . letting the smallest $a$ possible which is $a=b_0+1$ , we can see inequalty holds. hence $a\\ge b+1$ is all the answers for the left inequality. now look at the right inequality. let $g: N \\rightarrow N$ , $g(a)=12ab_0-a^3+b_0^3$ where $g(a) \\ge 0$ . note that $g'(a)= 12b_o-3a^2$ , $g''(a)=-6a^2$ . we can see that $g$ is strictly decreasing.then $a$ is bounded above. We have to find the maximal $a$ which $g(a) \\ge 0 $ is true. Letting $a=b_0+3$ , we can see that the inequality holds. and $a=b_0+4$ does not hold, hence we can see $\\max a = b_0+3$ . After that point, it is just case bash. that is, Cases $a=b+1, a=b+2,a=b+3$ The first second cases are impossible by simply putting to the original inequality, for the case $a=b+3$ , we can get $b=2$ . hence $a=5$ . we can see that these integers indeed holds, we are finished",
        "Sample Answer 14: Vulch wrote: $11ab \\le a^3 - b^3 \\le 12ab\\implies 11ab \\le (a-b)((a-b)^2 +3ab)\\le 12ab.$ $=11p\\le d(d^2 +3p)\\le 12p,$ where $p=ab,$ and $d=(a-b).$ Can anybody help me from here? Sure! You have $11p-3dp \\leq d^3 \\leq 12p-3dp$ but $d^3$ is positive, therefore $p(12-3d) > 0 \\implies 12 > 3d \\implies d \\leq 3$ We take cases and the conclusion follows",
        "Sample Answer 15: Clearly $a>b$ , let $a=b+x$ with $x\\in\\mathbb{Z^+}$ $11ab\\le a^{3}-b^{3} \\le 12ab$ $\\Rightarrow 11b^{2}+11bx \\le x^{3}+3bx^{2}+3b^{2}x \\le12b^{2}+12bx$ For $x\\ge4$ , $3bx^{2}\\ge12bx$ and $3b^{2}x\\ge12b^{2}$ $\\Rightarrow 3bx^{2}+3b^{2}x\\ge12b^{2}+12bx$ which results in contradiction, hence $x\\le3$ For $x=1$ , $8b^{2}+8b-1\\le0$ . No positive integer solution exist. For $x=2$ , $5b^{2}+10b-8\\le0$ . Again, no positive integer solution exist. For $x=3$ , $b^{2}+3b-11\\le0$ . Only $b=2$ satisfies. Therefore, the only solution is $(5,2)$ .",
        "Sample Answer 16: Note that clearly $a>b$ since $a^3>b^3$ . Let $x=a-b$ and $y=ab$ so that they are both positive. Then, $$11y\\leq x(x^2+3y)\\leq 12y$$ $$11\\leq \\frac{x^3}{y}+3x\\leq 12.$$ Case 1: $x=1$ . Then $$8\\leq \\frac{1}{y}\\leq 9,$$ but this is not satisfied by any positive integer $y$ . Case 2: $x=2$ . Then $$5\\leq \\frac{8}{y}\\leq 6,$$ but again this is not possible. Case 3: $x=3$ . Then $$2\\leq \\frac{27}{y}\\leq 3,$$ and since $y$ is a positive integer, $9\\leq y\\leq 13.$ However, remember that $a=b+3$ , so $y=ab=b(b+3)$ From $9\\leq y\\leq 13$ , only 10 can be expressed as $b(b+3)$ , so we must have $x=3,y=10$ so $$(a,b)=(5,2).$$ $x\\geq4$ is clearly not possible since $x^3/y$ is positive, so the only solution is $(5,2).$",
        "Sample Answer 17: $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \\leq 12ab$ Since $a^2 + b^2 \\geq 2ab,$ hence $(a-b)(3ab) \\leq a^3 - b^3 \\leq 12ab \\implies a-b \\leq 4$ . (further noticing that $a^2 + b^2 = 2ab$ iff $a=b$ which is impossible, hence $a^2 + b^2 > 2ab \\implies a-b \\leq 3)$ Case bash $a-b =1,2,3$ gives the only solution $(a,b)=(5,2)$ . QED.",
        "Sample Answer 18: Obviosly $a>b$ . Let $a=b+x$ where $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ . We get $A=(3x-11)b^2+(3x^2-11x)b+x^3\\geq0$ and $B=(3x-12)b^2+(3x^2-12x)b+x^3\\leq0$ . Now we will find the discriminant for $b$ in both equations. $\\Delta_A=-x^2(3x^2+22x-121)$ which needs to be less than or equal to zero, because $A\\geq0$ . $\\Delta_B=-3x^2(x+12)(x-4)$ which needs to be greater than or equal to zero, because $B\\leq0$ . Solving $\\Delta_A\\leq0$ and $\\Delta_B\\geq0$ in natural numbers we get $x=3$ . Now we need to solve $-2b^2-6b+27\\geq0$ and $-3b^2-3b+9\\leq0$ .
