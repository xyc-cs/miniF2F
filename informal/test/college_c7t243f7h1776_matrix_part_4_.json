        "Sample Answer 1: Take this det(A+B)+det(A+ \\varepsilonB)+...+det(A+ \\varepsilon n-1B)=n(det(A)+det(B)). Where \\varepsilon is a primitive root of x n+1=0. All you have to use are basic properties of determinants and of \\varepsilon. In the problem n|det(A)+1|=|det(A+I)+det(A+ \\varepsilonI)+...+det(A+ \\varepsilon n-1I)| \\leq |det(A+I)|+|det(A+ \\varepsilonI)|+...+|det(A+ \\varepsilon n-1I)| \\leq {for z=1/ \\varepsilon i} n|1+det(A)|. This means that all the inequalities above are equalities so |det(A+ \\varepsilon iI)|=|det(A)+1| for all i and the complex numbers det(A+ \\varepsilon kI) are colinear. Can't remember now how to continue. Get back to it later. Maybe somebody else could prove it.",
        "Sample Answer 2: I put P(x)=det(In+xA). Let P(x)=anx^n+..+a1x+1. It's obvious that an=det(A). Let \\varepsilon be the primitive root of the eqn x^n-1=0. Then I did the same thing as amfulger. You get |P( \\varepsilon ^k)|=|an+1| for all k from 0 to n-1 and, also, P( \\varepsilon ^k) are all equal because the sum of their moduli (is this the plural? ) = modulus of their sum, so they are all collinear and the ratio of each 2 must be positive, but since they have equal moduli, they must all be equal. Let P(1)=P( \\varepsilon)=..=P( \\varepsilon^(n-1))=z with z a complex number with modulus |an+1|. Then P(x)=an(x-1)*..*(x- \\varepsilon ^(n-1)) + z = an(x^n-1)+z = an*x^n+z-an, but the last coefficient of P is 1, so P(x)=an*x^n+1, so |1+an*x^n|<=|1+an| for all x with |x|=1. It should be really easy to derive an positive real from here. This is just for (a). I haven't even thought abt (b) yet.",
        "Sample Answer 3: Sorry \\varepsilon is a primitve root of x n-1, not x n+1."
